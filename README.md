# VanillaNets
Dive into the world of neural networks with VanillaNets. Inspired by **'Neural Networks From Scratch'** by Harrison Kinsley & Daniel Kukiela, this repository offers hands-on Python implementations, sans frameworks, providing a deep dive into machine learning fundamentals. Join me on a journey of exploration and learning, unraveling the mysteries of AI one line of code at a time.
